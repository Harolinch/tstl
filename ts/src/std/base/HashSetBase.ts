	 * <p> A common interface for hash set. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> {@link IHashSet}s are containers that store unique elements in no particular order, and which 
	 * allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> In an {@link IHashSet}, the value of an element is at the same time its <i>key</i>, that 
	 * identifies it uniquely. Keys are immutable, therefore, the elements in an {@link IHashSet} cannot be 
	 * modified once in the container - they can be inserted and removed, though. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Internally, the elements in the {@link IHashSet} are not sorted in any particular order, but 
	 * organized into buckets depending on their hash values to allow for fast access to individual elements 
	 * directly by their <i>values</i> (with a constant average time complexity on average). </p>
	 *
	 * <p> {@link IHashSet} containers are faster than {@link TreeSet} containers to access individual 
	 * elements by their <i>key</i>, although they are generally less efficient for range iteration through a 
	 * subset of their elements. </p>
