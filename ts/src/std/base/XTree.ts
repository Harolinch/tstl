	 * <p> Red-black Tree. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> A red-black tree is a kind of self-balancing 
	 * binary search tree. Each node of the binary tree has an extra bit, and that bit is often interpreted as the 
	 * color (<font color='red'>red</font> or <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>) of the node. These color bits 
	 * are used to ensure the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Balance is preserved by painting each node of the tree with one of two colors (typically called 
	 * '<font color='red'>red</font>' and '<font color='darkBlue'>black</font>') in a way that satisfies certain 
	 * properties, which collectively constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. When the tree 
	 * is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties. The 
	 * properties are designed in such a way that this rearranging and recoloring can be performed efficiently. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> The balancing of the tree is not perfect but it is good enough to allow it to guarantee searching in 
	 * O(log n) time, where n is the total number of elements in the tree. The insertion and deletion operations, 
	 * along with the tree rearrangement and recoloring, are also performed in O(log n) time. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Tracking the color of each node requires only 1 bit of information per node because there are only two 
	 * colors. The tree does not contain any other data specific to its being a 
	 * red-black tree so its memory footprint is almost 
	 * identical to a classic (uncolored) binary search tree. In many cases the additional bit of information can 
	 * be stored at no additional memory cost. </p>
	 *
	 * <h4> Properties </h4>
	 * <p> In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a 
	 * red-black tree: </p>
	 *
	 * <ol>
	 *	<li> A node is either <font color='red'>red</font> or <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. </li>
	 *	<li> 
	 *		The root is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can 
	 *		always be changed from <font color='red'>red</font> to <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, but not 
	 *		necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis. 
	 *	</li>
	 *	<li> All leaves (NIL; <code>null</code>) are <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. </li>
	 *  <li> 
	 *		If a node is <font color='red'>red</font>, then both its children are 
	 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. 
	 *	</li>
	 *  <li> 
	 *		Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of 
	 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes. Some definitions: the number of 
	 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes from the root to a node is the node's 
	 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font> depth; the uniform number of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> 
	 *		nodes in all paths from root to the leaves is called the <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>-height of 
	 *		the red-black tree. 
	 *	</li>
	 * </ol>
	 * 
	 * <p> <img src="http://samchon.github.io/typescript-stl/images/design/conceptual_diagram/Red-black_tree_example.svg" 
	 *			style="max-width: 100%" /> </p>
	 * 
	 * <p> These constraints enforce a critical property of red-black trees: the path from the root to the farthest 
	 * leaf is no more than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf. The result is that the tree 
	 * is roughly height-balanced. Since operations such as inserting, deleting, and finding values require 
	 * worst-case time proportional to the height of the tree, this theoretical upper bound on the height allows 
	 * red-black trees to be efficient in the worst case, unlike ordinary binary search trees. </p>
	 * 
	 * <p> To see why this is guaranteed, it suffices to consider the effect of properties 4 and 5 together. For a 
	 * red-black tree T, let B be the number of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes in property 5. Let the 
	 * shortest possible path from the root of T to any leaf consist of B <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes. 
	 * Longer possible paths may be constructed by inserting <font color='red'>red</font> nodes. However, property 4 
	 * makes it impossible to insert more than one consecutive <font color='red'>red</font> node. Therefore, 
	 * ignoring any <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> NIL leaves, the longest possible path consists of 2*B nodes, 
	 * alternating <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> and <font color='red'>red</font> (this is the worst case). 
	 * Counting the <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> NIL leaves, the longest possible path consists of 2*B-1 
	 * nodes. </p>
	 * 
	 * <p> The shortest possible path has all <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes, and the longest possible 
	 * path alternates between <font color='red'>red</font> and <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes. Since all 
	 * maximal paths have the same number of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes, by property 5, this shows 
	 * that no path is more than twice as long as any other path. </p>

		/**
		 * <p> Insert an element with a new node. </p>
		 *
		 * <p> Insertion begins by adding the node as any binary search tree insertion does and by coloring it 
		 * <font color='red'>red</font>. Whereas in the binary search tree, we always add a leaf, in the red-black 
		 * tree, leaves contain no information, so instead we add a <font color='red'>red</font> interior node, with 
		 * two <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> leaves, in place of an existing 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> leaf. </p>
		 *

		 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font> node, repainting a <font color='red'>red</font> node 
		 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font> (or vice versa), or a rotation. 
		 *	</li>
		 * </ul>
		 *
		 * <h4> Notes </h4>
		 * <ol>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		The label <i><b>N</b></i> will be used to denote the current node (colored 
		 *		<font color='red'>red</font>). In the diagrams <i><b>N</b></i> carries a blue contour. At the 
		 *		beginning, this is the new node being inserted, but the entire procedure may also be applied 
		 *		recursively to other nodes (see case 3). {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>} will denote 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i>'s parent node, {@link XTreeNode.grand_parent <b>G</b>} will denote <i><b>N</b></i>'s 
		 *		grandparent, and {@link XTreeNode.uncle <b>U</b>} will denote <i><b>N</b></i>'s uncle. In between 
		 *		some cases, the roles and labels of the nodes are exchanged, but in each case, every label continues 
		 *		to represent the same node it represented at the beginning of the case. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		If a node in the right (target) half of a diagram carries a blue contour it will become the current 
		 *		node in the next iteration and there the other nodes will be newly assigned relative to it. Any 
		 *		color shown in the diagram is either assumed in its case or implied by those assumptions. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		A numbered triangle represents a subtree of unspecified depth. A <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> 
		 *		circle atop a triangle means that <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>-height of subtree is greater 
		 *		by one compared to subtree without this circle. </li>
		 * </ol>
		 *
		 * <p> There are several cases of red-black tree insertion to handle: </p>
		 * 
		 * <ul>
		 *	<li> <i><b>N</b></i> is the root node, i.e., first node of red-black tree. </li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i>'s parent ({@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}) is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i>'s parent ({@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}) and uncle 
		 *		({@link XTreeNode.uncle <b>U</b>}) are <font color='red'>red</font>. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i> is added to right of left child of grandparent, or <i><b>N</b></i> is added to left 
		 *		of right child of grandparent ({@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>} is <font color='red'>red</font> and 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.uncle <b>U</b>} is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>). 
		 *	</li>

		 *		{@link XTreeNode.uncle <b>U</b>} is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>). 
		 *	</li>
		 * </ul>
		 *
		 * <h4> Note </h4>
		 * <p> Note that inserting is actually in-place, since all the calls above use tail recursion. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> In the algorithm above, all cases are chained in order, except in insert case 3 where it can recurse 
		 * to case 1 back to the grandparent node: this is the only case where an iterative implementation will 
		 * effectively loop. Because the problem of repair is escalated to the next higher level but one, it takes 
		 * maximally h⁄2 iterations to repair the tree (where h is the height of the tree). Because the probability 
		 * for escalation decreases exponentially with each iteration the average insertion cost is constant. </p>

		 * <p> Erase an element with its node. </p>

		 * <p> In a regular binary search tree when deleting a node with two non-leaf children, we find either the 
		 * maximum element in its left subtree (which is the in-order predecessor) or the minimum element in its 
		 * right subtree (which is the in-order successor) and move its value into the node being deleted (as shown 
		 * here). We then delete the node we copied the value from, which must have fewer than two non-leaf children. 
		 * (Non-leaf children, rather than all children, are specified here because unlike normal binary search 
		 * trees, red-black trees can have leaf nodes anywhere, so that all nodes are either internal nodes with 
		 * two children or leaf nodes with, by definition, zero children. In effect, internal nodes having two leaf 
		 * children in a red-black tree are like the leaf nodes in a regular binary search tree.) Because merely 
		 * copying a value does not violate any red-black properties, this reduces to the problem of deleting a node 
		 * with at most one non-leaf child. Once we have solved that problem, the solution applies equally to the 
		 * case where the node we originally want to delete has at most one non-leaf child as to the case just 
		 * considered where it has two non-leaf children. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> Therefore, for the remainder of this discussion we address the deletion of a node with at most one 
		 * non-leaf child. We use the label <b>M</b> to denote the node to be deleted; <b>C</b> will denote a 
		 * selected child of <b>M</b>, which we will also call "its child". If <b>M</b> does have a non-leaf child, 
		 * call that its child, <b>C</b>; otherwise, choose either leaf as its child, <b>C</b>. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> If <b>M</b> is a <font color='red'>red</font> node, we simply replace it with its child <b>C</b>,
		 *  which must be <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> by property 4. (This can only occur when <b>M</b> has 
		 * two leaf children, because if the <font color='red'>red</font> node <b>M</b> had a 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> non-leaf child on one side but just a leaf child on the other side, 
		 * then the count of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes on both sides would be different, thus the 
		 * tree would violate property 5.) All paths through the deleted node will simply pass through one fewer 
		 * <font color='red'>red</font> node, and both the deleted node's parent and child must be 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, so property 3 (all leaves are <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>) 
		 * and property 4 (both children of every <font color='red'>red</font> node are 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>) still hold. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> Another simple case is when <b>M</b> is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> and <b>C</b> is 
		 * <font color='red'>red</font>. Simply removing a <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> node could break 
		 * Properties 4 (“Both children of every <font color='red'>red</font> node are 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>”) and 5 (“All paths from any given node to its leaf nodes contain the 
		 * same number of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes”), but if we repaint <b>C</b> 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, both of these properties are preserved. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> The complex case is when both <b>M</b> and <b>C</b> are <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. (This 
		 * can only occur when deleting a <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> node which has two leaf children, 
		 * because if the <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> node <b>M</b> had a <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> 
		 * non-leaf child on one side but just a leaf child on the other side, then the count of 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> nodes on both sides would be different, thus the tree would have been 
		 * an invalid red-black tree by violation of property 5.) We begin by replacing <b>M</b> with its child 
		 * <b>C</b>. We will relabel this child <b>C</b> (in its new position) <i><b>N</b></i>, and its sibling (its 
		 * new parent's other child) {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}. ({@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} was 
		 * previously the sibling of <b>M</b>.) </p> 
		 *
		 * <p> In the diagrams below, we will also use {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>} for <i><b>N</b></i>'s new 
		 * parent (<b>M</b>'s old parent), <b>SL</b> for {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s left child, and 
		 * <b>SR</b> for {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s right child ({@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} cannot 
		 * be a leaf because if <b>M</b> and <b>C</b> were <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, then 
		 * {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}'s one subtree which included <b>M</b> counted two 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>-height and thus {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}'s other subtree 
		 * which includes {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} must also count two 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>-height, which cannot be the case if {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} 
		 * is a leaf node). </p>
		 *
		 * <h4> Notes </h4>
		 * <ol>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		The label <i><b>N</b></i> will be used to denote the current node (colored 
		 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font>). In the diagrams <i><b>N</b></i> carries a blue contour. At the 
		 *		beginning, this is the replacement node and a leaf, but the entire procedure may also be applied 
		 *		recursively to other nodes (see case 3). In between some cases, the roles and labels of the nodes 
		 *		are exchanged, but in each case, every label continues to represent the same node it represented at 
		 *		the beginning of the case. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		If a node in the right (target) half of a diagram carries a blue contour it will become the current 
		 *		node in the next iteration and there the other nodes will be newly assigned relative to it. Any 
		 *		color shown in the diagram is either assumed in its case or implied by those assumptions. 
		 *		White represents an arbitrary color (either <font color='red'>red</font> or 
		 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font>), but the same in both halves of the diagram. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		A numbered triangle represents a subtree of unspecified depth. A <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> 
		 *		circle atop a triangle means that <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>-height of subtree is greater 
		 *		by one compared to subtree without this circle. 
		 *	</li>
		 * </ol>
		 *
		 * <p> If both <i><b>N</b></i> and its original parent are <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, then 
		 * deleting this original parent causes paths which proceed through <i><b>N</b></i> to have one fewer 
		 * <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> node than paths that do not. As this violates property 5 (all paths 
		 * from any given node to its leaf nodes contain the same number of <font color='darkBlue'>black</font> 
		 * nodes), the tree must be rebalanced. There are several cases to consider: </p>
		 * 
		 * <ol>
		 *	<li> <i><b>N</b></i> is the new root. </li>
		 *	<li> {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} is <font color='red'>red</font>. </li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}, {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}, and 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s children are <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>. </li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} and {@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s children are 
		 *		<font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, but {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>} is 
		 *		<font color='red'>red</font>. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s left child is <font color='red'>red</font>, 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s right child is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, and 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i> is the left child of its parent. 
		 *	</li>
		 *	<li> 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>} is <font color='darkBlue'>black</font>, 
		 *		{@link XTreeNode.sibling <b>S</b>}'s right child is <font color='red'>red</font>, and 
		 *		<i><b>N</b></i> is the left child of its parent {@link XTreeNode.parent <b>P</b>}. 
		 *	</li>
		 * </ol>
		 *
		 * <p> Again, the function calls all use tail recursion, so the algorithm is in-place. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> In the algorithm above, all cases are chained in order, except in delete case 3 where it can recurse 
		 * to case 1 back to the parent node: this is the only case where an iterative implementation will 
		 * effectively loop. No more than h loops back to case 1 will occur (where h is the height of the tree). 
		 * And because the probability for escalation decreases exponentially with each iteration the average 
		 * removal cost is constant. </p>
		 * 
		 * <p> Additionally, no tail recursion ever occurs on a child node, so the tail recursion loop can only 
		 * move from a child back to its successive ancestors. If a rotation occurs in case 2 (which is the only 
		 * possibility of rotation within the loop of cases 1–3), then the parent of the node <i><b>N</b></i> 
		 * becomes <font color='red'>red</font> after the rotation and we will exit the loop. Therefore, at most one 
		 * rotation will occur within this loop. Since no more than two additional rotations will occur after 
		 * exiting the loop, at most three rotations occur in total. </p>
