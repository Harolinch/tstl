// Standard Template Library: Algorithms
// The header <algorithm> defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements.
//
// A range is any sequence of objects that can be accessed through iterators or pointers, such as an array or an 
// instance of some of the STL containers. Notice though, that algorithms operate through iterators directly on the 
// values, not affecting in any way the structure of any possible container (it never affects the size or storage 
// allocation of the container).
